# BME680_Driver_Implementation
Clone of the [Bosch Driver Repository](https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BME680_driver), implementation for the Raspberry Pi 1B.

I using the [Raspbian Netinstall](https://github.com/debian-pi/raspbian-ua-netinst) on a 2GB SD Card and the Breakout Board of the BME680 from [Watterott](http://www.watterott.com/de/BME680-Breakout).

I am also going to use the I2C / SPI Library from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/ . I am planning on using the I2C capabilities of the sensor and Raspberry for this.
